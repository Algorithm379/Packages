\usage{
Fi_score_region(pdb_df, i, j, include = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pdb_df}{Requires a PDB data frame generated by PDB_prepare}

\item{i}{start residue for a region}

\item{j}{end residue for a region}

\item{include}{inclusive or not calculation, default FALSE}
}
\value{
Fi-score value
}
\description{
Function calculates combined Fi-score for a selected region; NOTE: some PDB files have breakages in their amino acid sequences and those values cannot be assessed. Moreover, values can be calculated either inclusively or not; include is set to FALSE by default
}
